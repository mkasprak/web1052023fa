    <h2>Food Sensitivity vs. Allergy: What's the Difference?</h2>
    <p>
      Gluten-free baking is a fantastic way to enjoy
      <strong>gluten-free treats</strong> without glutenâ€”a protein found in
      wheat, barley, and rye. When you <strong>bake gluten-free</strong>, you
      use alternative flours like rice, almond, or coconut flour. These
      <strong>gluten-free flours</strong> don't have gluten, so they won't
      trigger sensitivities. With some practice, you can make
      <strong>delicious gluten-free treats</strong> just as tasty as traditional
      ones.
    </p>

    <h2>What's an Elimination Diet?</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine being a food detective. That's what an
      <strong>elimination diet</strong> is like. It involves temporarily
      removing specific foods from your diet to see if your symptoms get better.
      If they do, you've likely found a <strong>food sensitivity</strong>. It's
      a way to figure out what agrees with your body.
    </p>

    <h2>Symptoms of Food Intolerance</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Food intolerance</strong> can show up in various ways, such as
      stomach discomfort, gas, or headaches. If you often feel unwell after
      eating certain foods, pay attention to these signs. They can be your
      body's way of saying that a particular ingredient isn't your friend.
    </p>

    <h2>How Baking Gluten-Free Differs</h2>
    <p>
      Gluten-free baking is a bit like a fun science experiment. You might need
      different amounts of liquids and binders like xanthan gum to get the
      perfect texture. Don't worry; as you practice, you'll become a
      <strong>gluten-free baking expert</strong>!
